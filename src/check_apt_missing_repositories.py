"""InnoGames Monitoring Plugins - APT Package Source Check

This is a Nagios script which checks, if packages are installed which
are not available in any repository gotten from sources.lists and
sources.lists.d.  This check will not do apt-get update before it will
exit with 1 (warning) if packages without source repository are found.
An ignore file can be created to exclude packages that are installed
and, not available anymore.
