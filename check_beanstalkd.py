    Beanstalkd implements Memcached like simple TCP plain text protocol.
    It is enough to send "stats" request to it to get the metrics.  It is
    capable of handling multiple requests with a single connection, so
    the connection will remain open after the response.  It also returns
    the length of the response for us to know how many bytes we need to
    read.  Thought, we won't bother with those details.  We don't need to
    reuse the connection.  We will fetch 4096 bytes which is more than
    enough for the stats.

    We want to make sure that the connection is closed in any case and
    the program wouldn't hang waiting for the server to respond.  We will use
    2 second timeout to achieve this.
